- multithreading currently not working; only a placeholder
- add this program and dataanalysis, etc. to dataprocessing fields
- find ms2 precursor activation type in .tdf file (properties table?); currently hardcoded under write_ms2_spectrum(); maybe do this by adding support for unknown arguments, or just hardcode everything

- check .tdf file for instrument information
- add more logging messages
